# ChristmasTreeESP32

This is my first ever public PCB build. Version 0.1 is ordered from JLCPCB and should be here in a couple of days of writing this (12/03/2021).

Since this is quite early in the development of this project, the PCB can contain issues so be aware! In the future I'd love to have more control over the LEDs. Currently the tree only has 5 "zones" as seen in the preview of the software. I'd love to support individual adressing of the LEDs to create even better animations.

- Create animations with up to 256 frames! Thats a 128 Seconds long animation!
